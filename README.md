# ClimberBornAgain

Climber: Born Again is a short, high score based game with turn-based combat that connects to a  SQL database to save and view high scores. The original Climber was a Python program I created in high school with an extremely limited knowledge of programming (I didn't even know what a class was). Despite it's objectively poor programming, I was always fond of it, due most in part to it being my first independant programming project. Now that I've taken a few college programming courses, I decided to revisit Climber, reimagining and recreating it from the ground up in Java. Thus, Climber: Born Again was created.

In terms of installing, it should be as simple as downloading the repository as a .zip file and importing from .zip on your IDE. I need to double check as to whether or not this will work in every IDE (I wrote the program in NetBeans 14), and I'll update these instructions if I find out it doesn't work. As for the database, I'm looking into getting that posted as well, and I'll update this as soon as I work it out.
